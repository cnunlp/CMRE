## 📌 Introduction

Metaphor identification has traditionally been approached as a sequence labeling or a syntactically related word-pair classification problem. This research introduces a novel formulation, viewing metaphor identification as a relation extraction problem. The paper proposes metaphorical relations, which are connections between two spans in sentences: a target span and a source-related span. This approach allows for more flexible and precise text units beyond single words, capturing the properties of the target and the source. The research also introduces a dataset for Chinese metaphorical relation extraction, consisting of over 4,200 sentences annotated with metaphorical relations, target/source-related spans, and fine-grained span types. The dataset and models aim to bridge the gap between linguistic and conceptual metaphor processing.

## 🚀 Running the Model

1. **Select the Model:** 
   - FULL
   - STF-None
   - ITC

2. **Adjust Configuration File (`experiments.conf`):** 
   - For **FULL** or **ITC**: Set `use_span_type` to `true`.
   - For **STF-None**: Set `use_span_type` to `false`.

3. **Execute the Model:** 
   - Using Python: 
     - `python demo.py`
     - `python demo_ITC.py`
   - Using the shell script:
     - `sh test.sh`
     - Example: `sh test.sh FULL`

> **Tip**: Ensure configurations in `experiments.conf` are correct before execution.
